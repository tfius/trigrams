# Trigrams
Optimized generative algorithm capable of creating unique collections of trigrams, wrapped inside an ERC-721 interface. 

Inspired by [Autoglyphs](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs) 
The key difference with other NFTs is that the information  is inside the contract itself, it is literally “art on the blockchain.”

If you examine any glpyh creation transaction on the blockchain. The event data contains the full output of the generator, and hence the artwork itself.
